## Executive Summary

The **Namibia Digital Dollar (NADD)** is a blockchain-native, 1:1 Namibian Dollar-pegged stablecoin designed to modernize national payments, enable secure real-time transactions, and accelerate financial inclusion. NADD combines regulatory-compliant smart contracts, role-based governance, EIP-712 off-chain authorization, and reserve attestation to provide a transparent, auditable digital currency backed by fiat reserves.

This repository contains the project’s technical artifacts, deployment scripts, whitepaper, economic analysis, and testing scaffolding for sandbox and testnet operations.

----------

## Overview

NADD is built for safety, compliance, and programmability. It integrates with all BEP-20 compatible wallets including the **Abba App** to deliver mobile-first payments, merchant acceptance, and remittances. NADD is intended to be tested in the **Bank of Namibia Sandbox** before any mainnet deployment. The smart contracts are developed using OpenZeppelin patterns and follow strict role-based controls to limit privileged operations (mint, burn, pause).

## NADD Trust Framework

For a **comprehensive reference** covering NADD’s security, compliance, governance, reserves, economic integration, and lessons from successful private stablecoins, see the **NADD Trust Framework (v1.0)**:

**[NADD_TRUST_FRAMEWORK](./NADD_TRUST_FRAMEWORK.md)**

> This document is intended for internal review, regulatory transparency, and technical reference for developers, auditors, and partners.

It includes:

-   Expanded monetary context (Namibia’s M2, currency circulation, GDP, population)
-   Case studies from USDT, USDC, and other private stablecoins
-   Key Features and Technology Stack for security and compliance
-   Regulatory alignment with Bank of Namibia DPI, AML, and FATF standards
-   Proof-of-Reserves, attestation, and custodian redundancy
-   Governance, operational controls, and user protection measures
-   Economic integration and cross-border trade use cases

----------

## Key Features

-   **1:1 Peg** — Each NADD is intended to be fully backed by NAD reserves.
-   **Role-Based Governance** — DEFAULT_ADMIN, MINTER, BURNER, PAUSER, AUDITOR, CUSTODIAN.
-   **EIP-712 Authorization** — Off-chain deposit certificates signed by custodians to allow gas-efficient minting.
-   **Pausable** — Emergency pause/unpause for safety.
-   **Reserve Attestation Oracle** — On-chain record of attestation reports and reported reserves.
-   **Auditability** — All mint/burn events and attestation records are on-chain for public inspection.
-   **Abba App Integration** — Seamless UX for end-users and merchants.
-   **Sandbox-first** — Designed to operate under Bank of Namibia sandbox rules before any production deployment.

----------

## Technology Stack

-   **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (0.8.x), OpenZeppelin contracts (AccessControl, Pausable, ERC20, EIP-712).
-   **Dev & Test:** Hardhat, ethers.js, mocha/chai tests.
-   **Network Target:** BNB Smart Chain (BSC) Testnet initially; mainnet only after audits and sandbox approval.
-   **Oracles & Attestation:** Simple ReserveAttestationOracle for publishing attestations; off-chain auditors/custodians provide signed reports.
-   **Frontend / Mobile:** Abba App (Android/iOS) for wallet operations and KYC flows.
-   **Storage & Docs:** GitHub repo for source + public docs.

----------

## Token Economics

-   **Peg:** 1 NADD = 1 NAD (aimed).
-   **Minting:** Tokens are minted only when a verified fiat deposit certificate (signed by an authorized custodian) is presented to the contract and executed by a MINTER (multisig recommended).
-   **Burning:** Tokens are burned on redemption requests when custodial processes confirm fiat withdrawal.
-   **Reserve Management:** Custodial bank accounts hold reserves; ReserveAttestationOracle publishes attestations and links to audit reports.
-   **Supply Controls:** No automatic inflation — minting is strictly permissioned and tied to on-chain proofs of off-chain reserves.
-   **Use Cases:** P2P payments, merchant settlement, payroll, remittances, programmable disbursements (social support), and tokenized financial services.

----------

## Security & Compliance

-   **Design Principles:** Minimize attack surface, keep on-chain logic minimal and auditable, keep complex workflows off-chain where appropriate (but always provable).
-   **Libraries:** OpenZeppelin audited libraries used for ERC-20, AccessControl, Pausable, EIP-712 utilities.
-   **Roles & Operational Security:** MINTER/BURNER/CUSTODIAN keys should be held by different multisigs (e.g., Gnosis Safe) and covered by internal processes.
-   **Audits:** Multiple independent audits (internal, external) recommended before any production deployment.
-   **KYC/AML:** Integrated via Abba App; regulatory reporting and compliance logic designed for sandbox review.
-   **Upgradeability:** If upgradeability is required, use a timelock and multisig governance rather than single-key ownership. Prefer minimal upgradable surface and clear governance.

----------

## Roadmap

**Phase 0 – Research & Design**

-   Architecture design, regulatory outreach, partner onboarding (custodians, banks).

**Phase 1 – Dev & Test**

-   Smart contracts implemented; unit & integration tests; testnet deployment (BSC testnet).

**Phase 2 – Sandbox Integration**

-   Onboarding with Bank of Namibia sandbox; integration of custodial flows, KYC, & attestation processes; controlled pilot.

**Phase 3 – Audit & Security**

-   Third-party audits (OpenZeppelin-style recommended), bug bounties, formal verification of critical flows.

**Phase 4 – Production Readiness**

-   Finalize multisig governance, timelock, legal frameworks, insurance & custodial agreements.

**Phase 5 – Mainnet & Scale**

-   Mainnet deployment (post-sandbox & legal sign-off), merchant integrations, cross-border pilots, financial product expansion.

----------

## Risks & Mitigation

-   **Smart contract vulnerabilities** — mitigation: audits, minimal on-chain logic, tests, Slither/Static analysis.
-   **Custody & reserve risk** — mitigation: audited custodians, frequent attestations, public attestation history.
-   **Regulatory risk** — mitigation: sandbox engagement, legal counsel, KYC/AML integration.
-   **Operational compromise** — mitigation: multisig for all privileged roles, separation of duties, monitoring and alerts.
-   **User risk (key loss)** — mitigation: user education, optional custodial services, recovery flows for institutional accounts.

----------

## Governance & Operational Controls

-   Roles are assigned on deployment and must be controlled by secure governance (multi-sig, institutional custody).
-   Admin powers should be restricted; prefer time-locked governance proposals and multi-sig signoffs for major changes.
-   All attestations and mint/burn events are viewable on-chain for auditability.

----------

## Getting Started (Developer)

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (LTS recommended)
-   npm or yarn
-   Git client
-   MetaMask or wallet with testnet funds for deployment

### Installation

Clone and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abba-platforms/NADD.git
cd NADD
npm install

```

Create `.env` from `.env.example` and fill in values (don’t commit `.env`):

```
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
BSCTEST=https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/
NADD_ADDRESS=0xYourNADDAddress
BENEFICIARY=0xBeneficiaryAddress
AMOUNT=1
DEPOSIT_REF=BANKDEP-TEST-001

```

### Compile Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile

```

### Run Tests

```bash
npx hardhat test

```

Note: tests assume sample keys and local/testnet environment. Review tests and modify accounts/roles as needed.

----------

## Deploy (Testnet)

Deploy to BSC Testnet:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network bsctest

```

The deploy script will:

-   Deploy `NADDtoken` and `ReserveAttestationOracle`
-   Set initial admin roles (for testnet deployer)
-   Optionally grant CUSTODIAN_ROLE to a test key (not for production)

After deploy, copy the deployed contract addresses into `.env` (or the repo README) for reference.

----------

## How Minting Works (High-Level)

1.  Off-chain: Custodian receives fiat deposit and generates a `DepositCertificate` JSON including beneficiary, amount, currency, depositRef, timestamp, and nonce.
2.  Custodian signs the typed-data (`EIP-712`) using its custody key.
3.  Minter (on-chain actor, likely multisig) submits the certificate and the custodian signature to `mintWithCert()` in the `NADDtoken.sol` contract.
4.  Contract verifies signature against `CUSTODIAN_ROLE`, checks for replay (fiatRefHash), mints tokens to beneficiary, and marks certificate used.
5.  Attestation Oracle receives periodic reserve audit reports signed by auditors and publishes them for transparency.

----------

## Reserve Attestation & Oracle

`ReserveAttestationOracle` holds attestations with:

-   timestamp
-   submittedBy (attestor)
-   reportHash (hash of the off-chain audit report)
-   totalReserves (numeric)
-   uri (link to the attestation / report)

Design notes:

-   Oracles are simple on-chain records; heavy report content stays off-chain (IPFS/HTTPS).
-   Attestations are time-stamped to provide an audit trail and public verification.

----------

## Economic & Market Insights (Summary)

See `ECONOMY_OF_NADD.md` for the full analysis. In short:

-   NADD aims to reduce cash handling costs, speed settlement, and increase financial inclusion.
-   It supports remittances, merchant payments, and programmable disbursements (social programs/payments).
-   Reserve transparency (attestations & audits) is key to maintaining confidence in the peg.

----------

## Examples & Developer Tools

-   `scripts/sign-and-build-calldata.ts` — example script to produce an EIP-712 signature for deposit certificates and print ABI-encoded calldata for `mintWithCert`.
-   `test/` contains unit tests demonstrating minting flow (EIP-712 signing via ethers `_signTypedData` in tests), burn flows, pause/unpause, and oracle attestations.

----------

## CI / Quality Gate (Recommended)

-   Use GitHub Actions to:
    -   run `npx hardhat compile`
    -   run `npx hardhat test`
    -   run static analysis (Slither / MythX for deeper checks) on pull requests
-   Require passing checks for any change to contracts or critical scripts.

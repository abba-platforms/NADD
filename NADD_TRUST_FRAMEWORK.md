Version 1.0 â€” September 12, 2025

----------

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

The Namibia Digital Dollar ($NADD) is a blockchain-based stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Namibia Dollar (NAD). Its purpose is to digitize Namibiaâ€™s money supply, empower cross-border trade, and unlock the efficiencies of programmable money across Africa.

Namibiaâ€™s broad money supply (M2) currently stands at approximately **N$166 billion**, while currency in circulation is around **N$5.24 billion**. Namibiaâ€™s GDP is estimated at **N$400 billion**, and the country has a population of roughly **3.1 million**, providing a measurable user base for digital currency adoption. $NADD aims to serve both domestic commerce and cross-border trade corridors in Southern Africa, while seamlessly integrating into the local financial system through merchants, payment platforms, and mobile wallets like the Abba App by Abba Payments (maker of $NADD), eWallet by FNB Namibia, PayPulse by Standard Bank Namibia, EasyWallet by Bank Windhoek, Maris by MTC, and PayToday and NedMoney by Nedbank.

## ðŸ”‘ A. Lessons from Successful Private Stablecoins

Private issuers like USDT (Tether), USDC (Circle), Paxos/BUSD, TrueUSD, and Gemini Dollar demonstrate that trust in stablecoins comes from **reserves, audits, liquidity, adoption, and compliance**, not just government backing.

### 2. USD Coin (USDC)

-   **Issuer:** Circle / Centre Consortium.

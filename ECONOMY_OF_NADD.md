It is designed to modernize Namibia’s financial ecosystem, enable real-time digital transactions, and expand financial inclusion. This document provides a detailed economic and market analysis of NADD, highlighting its potential impact on the Namibian economy, monetary policy, and regional trade.

## 2. Macroeconomic Context

Namibia’s economy is characterized by:
